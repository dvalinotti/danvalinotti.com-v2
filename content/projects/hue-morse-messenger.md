My first React Native + Expo app, which utilized Philips' Hue Smart Lightbulb API, enabling users to send Morse Code messages to rooms in their house by flashing the lights. This also involved building a desktop app with React/Electron that starts an Express app to connect to Philips' Hue API. Not practical, but very fun!
