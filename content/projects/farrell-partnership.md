Designed, developed and deployed a new brand website for Farrell Partnership, LLC., an architecture firm based in New Jersey. I used Vue + Nuxt for server-side rendering, and Strapi.io for a CMS which greatly improved speed, user experience, and site reliability compared to the previous WordPress site.
